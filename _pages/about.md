I am a M.S. Student at Ajou University, working with Prof. [Jaehyun (Jason) So](https://movelab.ajou.ac.kr/people/1). I received my B.S. in Transportation Engineering from Ajou University in 2023.

My research centers on Traffic Operations, Transportation Safety, Driving Behavior, and Machine Learning and Data Science.

I'm interested in the intersection of AI and Transportation.

My recent working papers can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=dwmxOk0AAAAJ&hl=en).
