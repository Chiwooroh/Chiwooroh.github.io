I am a M.S. Student in Data/Network/AI Convergence Transportation Engineering program at Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea, working with Prof. [Jaehyun (Jason) So](https://movelab.ajou.ac.kr/people/1). I received my B.S. in Transportation Engineering from Ajou University in 2023.

I am currently part of the Mobility Operation design, Validation, and Enhancement Lab([MOVELAB](https://movelab.ajou.ac.kr)).

I am currently working on various projects in the field of Traffic Operation/Traffic Safety, including autonomous driving projects using traffic simulations(VISSIM, SUMO) and traffic accident prediction projects using AI models.

My research interests are Traffic Operations, Traffic Safety, Intelligent Transportation Systems, and Transportation Data Analysis like the intersection of AI and Transportation.

My recent working papers can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=dwmxOk0AAAAJ&hl=en).
